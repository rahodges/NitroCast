NitroCast Rapid Development Toolkit

This was the "secret sauce" in becomming a one-man shop for software development for multiple projects at once. Basically it was a hybrid-ORM tool that built purpose built components from a data model. The editor allows a user to build a data model and relationships, where then a code generator would build common libraries, a data layer, web editors, and supporting components for rapid application development.

This was updated from an earlier version called dbModel. This is here now in MIT license.
