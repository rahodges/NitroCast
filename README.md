NitroCast Rapid Development Toolkit

This was the "secret sauce" in becomming a one-man shop for software development for multiple projects at once. Basically it was a hybrid-ORM tool that generated purpose built components from a data model. The editor allows a user to build a data model and relationships, where then a code generator would build common libraries, a data layer, web editors, and supporting components for rapid application development. Not relying on reflection for editors keeps the speed of the generated editors rapid for web servers and user interaction.

Later evolution was guided toward creating export modules for various purposes, and was shelved when leaning into support for Retail Navigator and then Conductiv. Some are curious about how I did it, so now this is shared.

This was updated from an earlier version called dbModel. This is here now in MIT license.
