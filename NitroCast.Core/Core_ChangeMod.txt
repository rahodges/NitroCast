Version 1.5	- February 25, 2004
*	NEW FEATURE: Fields and Children can now be separated into "Folders" within Classes 
	for readability and code organization. This will also be used by code generators to
	provide fast routines to only read or update specific "folders" in the class.
	Saved files will be updated to the new version.
*	Fields and children can now be assinged specific orders in the classes.
*	Fields and Children editor saves "design state" of expanded and collapsed items;
	a real time saver during periods of frequent use.
Version 1.11 - January 11, 2004
*	Bug Fix: The model no longer has to be reloaded to generate fields names in code.
*	Added FCKeditor field editor.
Version 1.10 - December 11, 2003
*	Bug Fix: NitroCast crashes when generating code after creating new classes with
	child objects in a single session. DataTypes for new classes were incorrectly created.
*	Major overhaul of DataTypeManager and ChildDataType classes. While there
	are no significant changes visible to the client, the code is more efficient and
	easier to read.
*	ChildDataType properties IsCustom, IsInternal and IsReferenced are now obsolete yet
	remain for backward compatability. This will be removed in the future.

Version 1.00 - December 1, 2003
*	First initial release.
